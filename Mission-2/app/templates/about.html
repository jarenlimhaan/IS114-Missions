        >The Smart Home Alarm System, or SHAS, is a revolutionary alarm device designed specifically for rough sleepers. Unlike traditional alarms, SHAS offers a customizable wake-up schedule tailored to help users maintain a consistent daily routine.

        Recognizing that establishing a reliable wake-up pattern can be tedious and challenging, we have integrated the concept of gamificationâ€”the application of game elements in non-game contexts. By incorporating engaging games, we provide users with intrinsic motivation to rise and shine each morning. To turn off the alarm, users must complete one of two interactive games: a Flappy Bird-style game or a maze challenge. This design ensures that users are fully awake and alert, as they must focus entirely to succeed in these games, preventing the alarm from being silenced prematurely.
        
        Additionally, SHAS features a built-in timer that logs the time taken from when the alarm sounds to when the user finishes the game. This data helps users track their wake-up habits daily, even amidst the varied environments in which they sleep.
        
        Through a gamified alarm system with multiple interactive features, SHAS empowers users to reshape their sleep habits progressively and enhance their overall well-being.</b
