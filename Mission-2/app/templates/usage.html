            Using the Smart Home Alarm System (SHAS) is designed to be intuitive
            and engaging, ensuring a smoother wake-up experience.

          <div class="video-p-subtitle anim" style="--delay: 0.3s">
            To get started, users simply set their desired wake-up time through
            the app:
            <ol>
              <li>
                When the alarm goes off, it will initiate one of the built-in
                gamesâ€”a flappy bird or a maze challenge.
              </li>
              <li>
                To turn off the alarm, users must complete the game, which
                encourages full engagement and helps shake off sleepiness.
              </li>
              <li>
                As users play, a built-in timer records the duration between the
                alarm sounding and the completion of the game, providing
                valuable insights into their waking habits.
              </li>
            </ol>
            Users can review this data daily to identify patterns and make
            necessary adjustments to their sleep routine. With SHAS, waking up
            on time becomes a fun and interactive experience, ultimately
            promoting healthier sleep habits.
